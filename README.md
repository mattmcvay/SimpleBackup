# SimpleBackup Service
A Windows Service that backs up the contents of one folder location to another every 12 hours.
If the file already exists in the backup location, it is simply written over by default.
This service can be used by itself, or in conjunciton with the SimpleBackupUI project here: https://github.com/mattmcvay/SimpleBackupUI

For more info, see the the SimpleBackup Details.docx file.
